# Fitbit-Widget-Demo

This is a demo of the participant dashboard for progress monitoring of their Fitbit daily step count (using the Fitbit Widget) during the study intervention period. It simulates the dashboard that a participant in the control or treatment condition would see. For the demo, a random number generator is used so that you can see both conditions (though a participant in a real study would only see one condition).

Additional information about the purpose and functionality of the Fitbit project can be found on https://www.timothy-w-lee.com.
